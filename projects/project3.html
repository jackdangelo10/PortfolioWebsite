            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>As part of my Operating Systems class, I developed a custom Linux scheduling policy, supported by extensive code modifications and testing. The new policy, named SCHED_RR2, is designed to enhance Linuxâ€™s existing real-time round-robin (SCHED_RR) scheduler by introducing a boost feature that allows real-time tasks to extend their time quantum by a factor of two. My primary contributions involved modifying key kernel files, adding new variables and system calls, and implementing the SCHED_RR2 policy.</p>
            <p>To support this new policy, I added a <code>boost</code> variable and created a system call to set or modify this variable. The kernel modifications included extensive changes to various scheduling headers and core files to incorporate the new SCHED_RR2 policy. Additionally, I wrote user-level programs to test the new scheduler, contrasting its performance with the existing SCHED_RR policy. This project provided valuable hands-on experience in kernel development and real-time scheduling enhancements.</p>
